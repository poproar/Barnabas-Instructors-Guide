#### Review
   * Previous week  
   * Critical think based on previous question

### Step 1: Assembling the Racer (40 minutes) 
Study the instructions below and put the car together

![fig 5.2](fig-5_2.jpg){:class="image right"} **Servo Motors**  
Attach the servo motors with the nuts and bolts.  
Be sure to have the bolts insert from the outside.

### Step 2: Placing the Hardware (15 minutes)
Using your zip ties, tie your hardware down onto the car.  
Use the double stick foam tape on the back of the bread board to stick it onto the car chassis

![fig 5.5](fig-5_5.png){:class="image right"} **Top View**  
Attach the Noggin(tm) to the top side of chassis with zip ties. Be sure to leave the barrel jack accessible.
Using the sticky backside of the breadboard, place the breadboard firmly in the front edge of the chassis.
