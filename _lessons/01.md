### Part 1
Keep multiple:  ways of representation, ways of action and expression, and methods of engagement in mind.  
Make sure the classroom is set up in a community-building environment (chairs set in a circle, carpet space to sit in a circle, etc.)  
Share a little about yourself, like your background, and why you want to teach robotics.  You can also spend some time to do a little ice breaker to learn names.  
Explain the overall goal of the Barnabas program:  Creating a robot through encouragement and community, while exploring the four types of engineering (mechanical, electrical, hardware, and software).  

Discuss the meaning of Barnabas ("Son of Encouragement") and prompt students to provide examples of encouragement  
Discuss the meaning of community and prompt students to provide examples of community (classroom, neighborhood, sports team, cultural/religious community)
Present the essential question of the day:  "What are the similarities and differences between a robot and a human?"  
Go over the four goals of the class:  Build, Learn, Teach, and Inspire  
What are we building? (A robot)  
What will we learn? (The 4 types of engineering, encouragement, community building skills)  
Who will teach the class? (Everyone teaches each other in this collaborative learning environment)  
What does it mean to inspire? How will you inspire each other in this process? (Responses may vary)  

### Part 2
What makes a robot function? (the program, circuit board, batteries, physical body/casing)  
Go over the four parts of the human body:  Brain, Body, Heart, and Soul - What is the function of each of these parts?  
Take out the robot poster (or access digital "paper doll" robot via Scratch). Which part of the robot has a similar function to that of the human body (Brain, Body, Heart, and Soul)  
Briefly explain the 4 parts of the robot in relation to the 4 types of engineering:  
- Soul/Program - Software Engineering
- Heart/Batteries - Electrical Engineering
- Body/Casing - Mechanical Engineering
- Brain/Circuit board - Hardware Engineering
Allow students to respond to the debriefing questions  
Closing circle/debrief - Discuss the EQ of the day.

### Schoology
#### Explain the Goal
Share about the goals of the course through our 4 words: BUILD, LEARN, TEACH and INSPIRE. 

BUILD: We will each be building robots, character, and relationships.  We stress that this class is not just about building something fun and educational, but about growing as individuals.  We incorporate things like perseverance.  This is a great place to introduce concepts like grit and growth mindset.  We also share that it is our goal as instructors to get to know them through the class.
LEARN: We will be learning engineering as well as learning about ourselves.  
TEACH: We must share with others what we have learned and built.  We all teach - including the students.
INSPIRE: We should work to motivate others through what we teach to create positive change.  You may want to share an inspiring story at this point.
 

#### The meaning behind Barnabas
Encouragement: In Biblical Text, Barnabas is the son of encouragement.  Encouragement is important because it nurtures potential, especially when students are trying new challenges. 
Community: Barnabas was a leader who brought people together to accomplish a greater goal (Paul and Peter).  We are more powerful when we work and communicate as communities or teams.  Individually, we all have our strengths and weaknesses.
Explain that the students are now part of a community (or team), and you are the coach.  Let them know that you are there for them and that it is your job to create a safe environment for intellectual and emotional growth.

#### Why we document
Explain that documenting their work in their notebooks is important because 1. we can then remember what we built and learned and 2. others can learn from our work.  This helps prepare students to use lab books in high school.
If you have journals, pass them out at this point
If you are using our online schoology system for journaling, have your students create a schoology student account.

Have kids break up into groups of two to four.
Pass out the engineering notebooks and have the students write their names on their copies.  Have them answer:
What do robots help us do?  
Then have then draw their favorite robot.

Have the students share their answers within the groups, and then expand it to a class discussion.
Here are several positive examples of what robots do:
Personal Robotics: Roomba, Jibo
Farming: Robots can water crops
Photography: Drones for photography and video
Humanity: prosthetic arms, mine removers, military rescue bots
Healthcare: robotic surgery, small robots for diagnosis
Science: Moon rovers, space exploration, ocean exploration
Manufacturing: car manufacturing, painting
Delivery: drones
Security: cameras that follow you
This is also a good time to show that robots are a tool that can have positive and negative uses.  For example, the same drones as above can be used in military campaigns with significant civilian casualty, and autonomous cameras hold significant risks to personal privacy.  We think it is important to come to robotics engineering with a sense of social responsibility.

What Makes Up A Robot?
Have a volunteer come up to the front of the class and draw their robot.  Building upon their drawing, explain the three parts of building a robot.
The body of the robot is a good analogy for mechanical engineering.  The arms, legs, and head (and possibly other additions) make up the body.  The body creates a physical framework so that the robot can accomplish its tasks.  This is mechanical engineering.
The nervous and cardiac systems are a good analogy for the electrical engineering component of the robot.
The heart is the battery, which is uses wires to transport power to the rest of the body (arteries, veins capillaries).
There is usually a central electronic device, which is analogous to the brain, which is directly powered by the battery (using veins) and sends information to the rest of the body (using nerves).  In our kit, this device is the Arduino.
Our physical brain by itself cannot tell us to write sentences or shoot a basketball.  As we learn things, we store memories and instructions in a part of our brain that we cannot see or sometimes understand.  We are learning more about this consciousness in science.  This consciousness is analogous to software engineering.  We have to write instructions so that our robots can perform their commands.
Explain that we will learn about each part and put it all together at the end to make our very own robot.


## Worksheet 1 - Introduction to Robotics

### STEP 1:  The meaning of "Barnabas"
- Barnabas means "Son of Encouragement."
- Barnabas was a community builder.
🗨 or ✎:  What does "encouragement" mean to you? How do you encourage others?  
🗨 or ✎:  What does "community" mean you? Name or draw 2 communities of which you are a part and your role in each of them.  

### STEP 2:  Understanding our goals.
🗨 or ✎:  What will we BUILD throughout this program?  
🗨 or ✎:  What will we LEARN?  
🗨 or ✎:  Who will TEACH the class?  
🗨 or ✎:  How will we INSPIRE each other during this process?  

### STEP 3:  What is a robot?
🗨:  What do you know about robots?  
🗨 or ✎:  What do robots help us do?  

### STEP 4:  What are the parts of a robot?
 ✎:  Write down the four parts necessary for a robot to function.
1. _
2. _
3. _
4. _

Draw today’s robot and label it with the above parts.  

The four basic parts of a robot represent the four branches of engineering.  Draw a straight line to connect each part of the robot to the type of engineering that it represents.  

|Part           |   |Engineering |
|    ---:       |---|   :---     |
|Circuit board ●|   |● Mechanical|
|Casing        ●|   |● Electrical|
|Program       ●|   |● Hardware  |
|Batteries     ●|   |● Software  |

✎:  Write down four basic parts of a human that can be likened to the robot parts above.
